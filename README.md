# Transformation-based Organic Molecular Ecological Network Analysis (TOMENA)

**TOMENA** is a framework to detect **molecular transformation** and conduct downstream analysis. This framework was designed for the analysis of **large-scale, high-resolution mass spectrometry data** with quantitative information and clear molecular formulas. Theoretically, as long as reliable quantitative information and molecular formulas are provided, this framework can be applied to a wide range of systems and downstream data from various analytical instruments. 

The method offers several notable features: 

First, by detecting non-independent nature between quantitative correlations and molecular differences, each identified transformation type undergoes statistical validation. Since molecular abundance data are considered when determining transformations, the results more closely reflect the actual organic matter turnover occurring within ecosystems.

Second, TOMENA does not require a predefined dataset of molecular transformation types, enabling the discovery of previously unrecognized metabolic activities. Identified transformation patterns can further inform molecular difference-based comparisons, allowing researchers to focus on confirmed, empirically validated transformation types. 

Third, TOMENA assigns precursor-product directions to molecular pairs based on time-lagged correlation strength, facilitating the investigation of specific transformation patterns in complex systems and aiding in the disentangling of decomposition and synthesis processes. 

Fourth, we constructed a organic molecular network by linking molecules based on their transformation associations, offering a network topology-based strategy for analyzing overall transformation characteristics.
